# Chiagarden

Chiagarden is a collection of tools designed to help you build, manage, and maintain a Chia PoST farm on a linux based system. These tools make it easier to prepare and mount your hard disks, and manage your plots for your PoST farm.

## chiainit

[chiainit](https://github.com/efnats/chiagarden/tree/main/chiainit) is a bash script that helps you prepare and manage hard drives for PoST (Proof of Space and Time) farming. It automates the process of wiping, formatting, and labeling multiple drives at once, making it easy to set up and maintain your Chia farming storage.

## garden-mount

[garden-mount](https://github.com/efnats/chiagarden/tree/main/ helps you mount or unmount Chia-labelled drives based on a specified label prefix. Additionally, this repository provides two systemd service files for managing the mounting and unmounting process.

## plotting

In [plotting](https://github.com/efnats/chiagarden/tree/main/plotting), you will find scripts for managing and automating the plotting process. These tools make it easier to count, move and replot your PoST plots
